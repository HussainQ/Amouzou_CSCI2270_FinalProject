# Amouzou_CSCI2270_FinalProject


Let's be frank here. I'm totally not done, but I will be this Friday morning. I'd really appreciate it if you helped me out and gave me more time cause I'm a procrastinating idiot.



This project will be an N-ary tree representation of a business hierarchy. 
It'll take the names of the employee and various employee data and organize them according to rank and senority.
Each employee will be a node and their direct senior being their parent.
The children of a node are subordinate employees listed according to rank.
Additionally, this project will visualize the business hierarchy and each employee by printing them out in a tree.
It'll also have methods for accessing and modifying employee data.
The end user will be able to utilize the tree through the linux terminal
