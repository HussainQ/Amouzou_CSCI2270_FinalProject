# Amouzou_CSCI2270_FinalProject

This project will be an N-ary tree representation of a business hierarchy. 
It'll take the names of the employee and various employee data and organize them according to rank and senority.
Each employee will be a node and their direct senior being their parent.
The children of a node are subordinate employees listed according to rank.
Additionally, this project will visualize the business hierarchy and each employee by printing them out in a tree.
It'll also have methods for accessing and modifying employee data.
The end user will be able to utilize the tree through a simplified GUI.
